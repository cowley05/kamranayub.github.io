My wife and I just started a crafting and DIY blog, [Looks Good to Us](https://looksgoodtous.com) last week. We have new posts every Wednesday and you can subscribe to get weekly updates. You can also follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/looksgoodtous) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/looksgoodtous).

## DIY, Sewing, and Knitting, Oh My!

While _this_ blog revolves around technology and personal topics, LGTU is focused on my and Cassie's shared hobby of crafts: I like home automation, DIY, and "Maker" activities, she likes knitting and sewing. She frankly does much more than I do, since I have like 5 hobbies and she mostly has just the two (good for her!). You can read about it in our [Welcome](https://looksgoodtous.com/welcome) post.

There are two things I focused on with how I launched this new blog. I **optimized for time** and **avoided yak shaving.**

## Optimize for Time

First, I optimized for frictionless writing. I needed something *fast* and *collaborative* because my wife is not a developer and I wanted to remove any excuse *not* to write. So I used [Ghost](https://ghost.org) and self-hosted it on a [Digital Ocean 1-click droplet](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/ghost) (if you use it, help me out and [use my referral link](https://m.do.co/c/1026c3c0c89b)). Digital Ocean is awesome and the process only took an evening and we were up and running. More on that later!

Ghost is amazing ðŸ¤© It uses the same editor Medium does which my wife and I used when we wrote posts during [our travels](https://kamranicus.com/travel). I also love the seamless workflow for drafting, scheduling, and editing. It allows my wife and I to schedule out posts ahead of time, essentially self-imposing a deadline each week, as shown below:

Congratulations, you get a sneak peek! The workflow is great and really removes all the barriers to writing that my lizard brain requires.

## No Yak Shaving Allowed

The second thing I did differently, I didn't [shave any yaks](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx): 

> "Yak shaving is what you are doing when you're doing some stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what you're supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal relations links what you're doing to the original meta-task." - Scott Hanselman

We developers are *great* at yak shaving. I could have spent a month making a logo (I spent 30 mins), customizing the theme (I made one edit), and designing a CI/CD DevOps-y Git-integrated workflow (I just use Ghost). By the time the blog would have launched, it would be *perfect* and also I would have wasted months (or years, if you shave a lot of yaks).

It reminds me of a quote I recently heard on a podcast:

> "If you aren't embarassed by your first version, you're launching too late."

So I didn't sweat it. I talked to my wife and we came up with a rotating weekly cadence. We already have 4-5 weeks of content. At this rate, we could even think about switching to twice a week but frankly I want to just give us some breathing room in-between posts. The fact that each of us gets 2 weeks is perfect right now.

## Be consistent

The number one recommendation I keep hearing over and over from successful content creators is that **consistency** is crucial to building an audience. Fostering a community is also incredibly important. I made sure that we can do both for LGTU by enabling comments and hooking up the blog subscription to [Mailchimp](http://eepurl.com/gpjY_H) (my referral link again!), which is what I use for my own newsletter.

I need to do better for _this_ blog and it's on my list for this next year. I wish I could do it in an evening but due to the way all my source is in Markdown, I'll need to convert my posts for Ghost (they have a JSON import, though). It'll be added to my goals, don't worry. ðŸ˜‰
