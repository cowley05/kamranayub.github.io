Lead: The recorded version of my talk at MDC 2019 is now available. I received positive feedback and I think it had to do with some key changes I made.

I had the opportunity to speak at [MDC 2019](https://mdc.ilmservices.com) recently and recorded my talk [Designing a Flexible UI Architecture with React and GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCawL3nAnUA&list=PLmmRwaXW1nVTi2uv1vpy9B7pvI0X-vMc4&index=7&t=0s). I think it's even better than the version I gave [at NDC MN](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2019-02-01-ndc-minnesota-flexible-ui-with-react-graphql-typescript) earlier this year.

## What's the talk about?

Here's the abstract:

> If your application suffers from hard-to-debug UI state, complex client-side business rules, and has trouble scaling to meet your performance needs you might be tearing your hair out. In this session I will share how we shifted the way we thought about our application using a 3 step process from the ground up. I’ll show you how we built a declarative “schema-driven UI” engine built on React and GraphQL that could manage business complexity and still scale to meet future business requirements.
>
> I'll share our approach, some challenges we faced and advice for your own applications so you can design your own declarative schema-driven UI architecture that fits your business needs. Don’t fret if you don’t use React or GraphQL because this pattern can be introduced into any framework you might be using.

## What did people say?

Like I said, I thought this went even better than the one I gave at NDC ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIejhIX7ObE&list=PLmmRwaXW1nVTi2uv1vpy9B7pvI0X-vMc4&index=2)).

This last session was rated **4.3/5** out of 25 ratings. 💖 Some specific feedback I got:

> "so much content!!!"

> "useful approach"

> "very handy guide to UI design with any technology"

🙏 I was very happy to read these! I even had to cut out content to fit within 50 minutes.

I also had a couple people come up afterwards who said they thought the content was great and "impressive." Great!

> "wish would of talked more generic graphQL and react to"

I _think_ this last comment was referring to maybe adding more introductory content around GraphQL/React. Totally fair but I think the case study and design methodology are the focal points and for an intermediate talk, I don't have enough time to introduce React much though I _do_ spend at least 5-8 minutes on why GraphQL was a good fit for this architecture.

## What did I change?

I made a few changes structurally to the presentation that I think made it even better this time around.

### Wrote a script

What! Actually this is something I've had to admit about myself. It's better if I write out my thoughts first to get them in order and be more articulate. I have time to mull it over and edit. I did this on my last two courses and it made a real difference in quality.

Each of the slides now has full speaker notes and I practiced reading through it several times to get the flow and points straight that I wanted to make.

### Cut out the bio

I got rid of the "about me" section and replaced with a single slide at the end with resources. I basically launch into the talk and _then at the end_ when people have heard what I have to say, they can look me up. This was some advice I came across online from somewhere (maybe [this](https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp) or [even this meta talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzVr_nsKoZs&feature=youtu.be)) that I implemented.

### Start with the point

My teacher in high school gave me this advice about speaking: 

> "Tell them what you want to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them."

I didn't know it until later but this advice actually originated from [Aristotle](https://www.inc.com/john-baldoni/deliver-a-great-speech-aristotle-three-tips.html). I am reading some books on rhetoric currently so that was neat to learn.

Even though I _knew this_ intellectually it hit home more after we had an internal guest speaker at work, Frances Frei, talk about rebuilding trust. It was a lengthier version of her [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVeq-0dIqpk) which I highly recommend. 

She says if you're having a hard time getting your point across, it may be because you take a long, winding road to get to your point. Instead, just *start with your point* and people will be more engaged.

So that's what I did, my second slide is the whole point of the presentation. Then I follow Aristotle's advice and summarize at the end.

### Divide into 3 parts

Everything is better in threes. I divided the talk into 3 main sections and I think that really helped keep the flow and structure solid in people's minds.

## What would I change?

Plenty. Each time I give a talk it surfaces more things I'd change. 

- I'd like to do more with the Adobe XD design I made: animations, callouts, etc. 
- I think I'll redo the GraphQL section next time. 
- I want to add a "post-mortem" section again, I took it out due to time but I might be able to save on time other places. 
- I would **love** to show a minimal demo/sample using one of the libraries I mention.

I might have a chance to do these things, I've submitted the talk to several more conferences for 2020. Wish me luck!
