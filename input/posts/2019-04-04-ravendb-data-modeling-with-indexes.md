I recently had an opportunity to work with [Ayende](http://ayende.com) from Hibernating Rhinos and creator of [RavenDB](https://ravendb.net) to take some posts of his regarding data modeling with indexes and bring them to a wider audience. I enjoy working with RavenDB and as you might know, even have a [Getting Started course](http://bit.ly/PSRavenDB4) on it so I was happy to work with HN to write an article on the subject.

[Data Modeling with Indexes in RavenDB](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1348454/Data-Modeling-with-Indexes-in-RavenDB) 
went live today on CodeProject and covers how indexes work in Raven and some simple to advanced use cases to show off 
their power. Be sure to check it out!

I'm excited to be working with HN to bring some more articles to a wider audience so I'll be sure to share when any other articles go live.
