I just published my first Pluralsight guide: [How to Statically Type React Components with TypeScript][guide]. I cover the basics of how to annotate React components, props, state, and events with TypeScript. Go ahead and check it out!

As you may know if you [follow me on social media][twitter], baby #2 dropped in November so I'm taking a good amount of time before I commit to a big contract like [doing two Pluralsight courses at once](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2018-10-18-new-azure-pluralsight-courses). That was well worth it but quite a feat.

Still--I'm not one to sit around long and evenings are still protected time. One thing I love about doing Pluralsight work is that they have a myriad of opportunities besides just doing video courses. One of them is assessments, which I did a few months back, by writing questions for the JavaScript ES6 assessment (I worked with 2 other authors on that). Another recent opportunity has been [Guides][guides] which are in their infancy. I imagine the team has big plans for that section of the site.

I reached out to my ASM last week and said I'd be interested in some low-key work and guides came up as a good activity, so I took a look and *lo and behold* I had struck some gold. It turns out, they need some guides around using React with TypeScript.

And you know what I think about that. [I like it a lot](/events).

So I offered to start with the first objective I thought I could tackle. It took me about 4 hours and that included planning and rewriting it once to adhere to the standards/guidelines. I think next time I'll be able to get it down to 2-3 hours. I'm always willing to try these opportunities 2-3 times before deciding if they're worth the investment. The time tracking I started doing for the last courses helps immensely!

Looking forward to the next guide, which I'll pick up next week hopefully!
